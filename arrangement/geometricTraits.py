    This class is to represent circle objects
    It is aggregated from sympy.Circle class, hence the name.
    The sympy.Circle is stored in self.obj
    It has two aditional parameters, and extra methods.
    additional parameters are:
    t1: the stating angle of the arc
    t2; the ending angle of the arc

    potential screw_up
    theta \in [-pi, pi])
    so how to define an arc where (t1,t2)=(pi/2, 3pi/2)
    well, best is to allow any interval ([-pi, pi] or [0, 2pi])
    and always check the tvalues +2pi and -2pi to see if whether they are
    in the range

    note:
    -----
    note that "ArcModified" is a subClass of "CircleModified"
    but the self.obj is aggregated from sym.Circle

    usage:
    ------
    pc, rc, interval =  (0,0), 1, (0,numpy.pi)
    am =  mSym.ArcModified( args=( pc, rc, interval )  )
